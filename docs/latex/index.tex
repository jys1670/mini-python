An interpreter consists from several parts\+:

1) Lexical analyzer — reads symbols stream and groups them into meaningful sequences called lexemes. Each lexeme is then used to generate so-\/called token.

2) Syntax analyzer — reads token stream and generates abstract syntax tree (AST). Each inner node represents some kind of operation, where child nodes are its arguments.

3) Semantic analyzer — traverses AST, completes node actions, updates symbols table.
