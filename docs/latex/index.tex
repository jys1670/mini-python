This is educational mini-\/\+Python interpreter build under the guidance of yandex practicum. The project consists of several independent parts\+:

1) {\itshape Lexical analyzer} — reads symbols stream and groups them into meaningful sequences called lexemes. Each lexeme is then used to generate so-\/called token.

2) {\itshape Syntax analyzer} — reads token stream and generates abstract syntax tree (AST). Each inner node represents some kind of operation, where child nodes are its arguments.

3) {\itshape Runtime module} — traverses AST, completes node actions according to their semantics, updates symbols table, etc.
